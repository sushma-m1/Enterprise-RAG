## Admin Panel

In the **Admin Panel** you can access three views using the following tabs: [Control Plane](#control-plane), [Data Ingestion](#data-ingestion) and [Telemetry & Authentication](#telemetry--authentication).

### Control Plane

The **Control Plane** view shown above allows the user to see all the components of the currently deployed pipeline as a graph. Each service can be selected from the graph to get further information on the configuration settings of each service. In some components it is also possible to edit service arguments for the services.

For example, when you click on the LLM service, as shown in the screenshot below, the right pane is populated with the LLM parameters that can be modified like `max_new_tokens`, `temperature` etc. To confirm parameters changes, click **Confirm Change** button.

From **Control Plane** view you are also able to change currently used prompt templates by selecting Prompt Template service node from the graph. Edit current prompt templates and click "Confirm Changes" to update them.

> [!NOTE]
> Prompt Templates cannot be empty and have to contain three placeholders: **{user_prompt}**, **{reranked_docs}** and **{conversation_history}** that can be placed anywhere in both templates once. In case any of these requirements are not met, an error message will be displayed on the screen under text inputs as shown below.
