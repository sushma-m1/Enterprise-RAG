## Hardware Prerequisites for Deployment using Gaudi® AI Accelerator

To deploy the solution on a platform with Gaudi® AI Accelerator we need to have access to instance with minimal requirements:

-  **logical cores**: A minimum of `48` logical cores
-  **RAM memory**: A minimum of `250GB` of RAM though this is highly dependent on database size
-  **Disk Space**: `1TB` of disk space is generally recommended, though this is highly dependent on the model size and database size
-  **Gaudi cards**: `8`
-  **Latest Gaudi driver**: To check your Gaudi version, `run hl-smi`. If Gaudi version doesn't match the required version, upgrade it by following [this tutorial](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Driver_Installation.html).


If you don't have a Gaudi® AI Accelerator, you can request these instances in [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://console.cloud.intel.com/home) to run Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG.

- Visit [ai.cloud.intel.com](https://ai.cloud.intel.com/) and register.
- on [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://console.cloud.intel.com/home) the left pane select `Preview > Preview catalog`.
- Select `Gaudi® 2 Deep Learning Server`, we recommend choosing a Bare Metal machine with 8 Gaudi devices to be able to meet hardware requirements.
- request instance
- As there is a limited number of machines with Gaudi accelerators, you need to be whitelisted to be able to access them. Therefore:
  - Send your email, Account ID, and information that you have requested an instance to [EnterpriseRAGRequest@intel.com](mailto:EnterpriseRAGRequest@intel.com) so we could add you to the whitelist.
- on Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud the left pane select `Catalog > Hardware`. Once you are added to the whitelist you should see Gaudi instances available.
- Select the Machine image - for example: `ubuntu-2204-gaudi2-1.20.1-*` with `Architecture: X86_64 (Baremetal only)`. Please note that minor version tags may change over time.
- Upload your public key and launch the instance
- Navigate to the `Instances` page and verify that the machine has reached its ready state, then click on "How to Connect via SSH" to configure your machine correctly for further installation.


## Hardware Prerequisites for Deployment using Xeon only
To deploy the solution on a platform using 4th or 5th generation Intel® Xeon® processors, you will need:
- access to any platform with Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors that meet bellow requirements:
-  **logical cores**: A minimum of `80` logical cores
-  **RAM memory**: A minimum of `250GB` of RAM
-  **Disk Space**: `500GB` of disk space is generally recommended, though this is highly dependent on the model size

### Software Prerequisites
-   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
-   **Hugging Face Model Access**: Ensure you have the necessary access to download and use the chosen Hugging Face model. This default model used is `Mixtral-8x7B` for which access needs to be requested. Visit  [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) to apply for access.

#### Additional Software Prerequisites when using Gaudi® AI Accelerator
-   **Gaudi Software Stack**: Verify that your setup uses a valid software stack for Gaudi accelerators, see  [Gaudi support matrix](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Support_Matrix/Support_Matrix.html). Note that running LLM on a CPU is possible but will significantly reduce performance.

# Pre-Installation

It is recommended to use python3-venv to manage python packages.

```sh
cd deployment
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv erag-venv
source erag-venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yaml --upgrade
```

# Configuration File

To prepare the configuration file, create a copy of the sample:

```sh
cd deployment
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/test-cluster
```

## Simplified Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

> **Note:** If you already have a Kubernetes cluster prepared, you can skip directly to the [Application Deployment on a Custom Cluster](#application-deployment-on-a-custom-cluster) section.

1. **Edit the inventory file:**
   - Open `inventory/test-cluster/inventory.ini`.
   - Replace `LOCAL_USER`, `REMOTE_USER`, `MACHINE_HOSTNAME`, and `MACHINE_IP` with your actual values.

Example `inventory.ini` for a single-node cluster:
```ini
# Kubernetes Cluster Inventory
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_user=LOCAL_USER

[all]
# Control plane nodes
MACHINE_HOSTNAME ansible_host=MACHINE_IP

# Define node groups
[kube_control_plane]
MACHINE_HOSTNAME

[kube_node]
MACHINE_HOSTNAME

[etcd:children]
kube_control_plane

[k8s_cluster:children]
kube_control_plane
kube_node

# Vars
[k8s_cluster:vars]
ansible_become=true
ansible_user=REMOTE_USER
ansible_connection=ssh
```

For more information on preparing an Ansible inventory, see the [Ansible Inventory Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html).

2. **Edit the configuration file:**
   - Open `inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml`.
   - Fill in the required values for your environment.

Example `config.yaml` for deploying a new Kubernetes cluster:
```yaml
# Uses kubespray to deploy Kubernetes cluster and install required components
deploy_k8s: true
# Local path provisioner works only with kubespray deployment, so deploy_k8s must be true to install it.
install_csi: "local-path-provisioner" # available options: "local-path-provisioner"

gaudi_operator: true # set to true when Gaudi operator is to be installed
habana_driver_version: "1.21.1-16" # habana operator from https://vault.habana.ai/ui/native/habana-ai-operator/driver/

huggingToken: FILL_HERE # Provide your Hugging Face token here
kubeconfig: FILL_HERE # Provide the absolute path to the kubeconfig file generated by kubespray, e.g. /home/user/code/ERAG/deployment/inventory/test-cluster/artifacts/admin.conf

# Proxy settings are optional
httpProxy:
httpsProxy:
# If HTTP/HTTPS proxy is set, update the noProxy field as needed:
noProxy: #"localhost,.svc,.monitoring,.monitoring-traces"
# ...
pipelines:
  - namespace: chatqa
    samplePath: chatqa/reference-cpu.yaml # For HPU deployment, use chatqa/reference-hpu.yaml
    resourcesPath: chatqa/resources-reference-cpu.yaml # For HPU deployment, use chatqa/resources-reference-hpu.yaml
    type: chatqa
```
3. **Prepare variables:**

```sh
ansible-playbook -K playbooks/setup.yaml --tags prepare-vars,configure -i inventory/test-cluster/inventory.ini -e @inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml
```

4. **Deploy the cluster:**

```sh
ansible-playbook -K playbooks/infrastructure.yaml --tags install -i inventory/test-cluster/inventory.ini -e @inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml
```

### Cluster Deletion

To remove the cluster, run:

```sh
ansible-playbook -K playbooks/infrastructure.yaml --tags delete -i inventory/test-cluster/inventory.ini -e @inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml
```

## Application Deployment on a Custom Cluster

1. **Edit the configuration file:**
   - Open `inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml`.
   - Set `deploy_k8s: false` and update the other fields as needed for your environment.

Example `config.yaml` for deploying on an existing cluster:
```yaml
# Uses kubespray to deploy Kubernetes cluster and install required components
deploy_k8s: false
# Local path provisioner works only with kubespray deployment, so deploy_k8s must be true to install it.
install_csi: "" # available options: "local-path-provisioner"

huggingToken: FILL_HERE # Provide your Hugging Face token here
kubeconfig: FILL_HERE  # Provide the absolute path to your kubeconfig (e.g. /home/ubuntu/.kube/config)

# Proxy settings are optional
httpProxy:
httpsProxy:
# If HTTP/HTTPS proxy is set, update the noProxy field as needed:
noProxy: #"localhost,.svc,.monitoring,.monitoring-traces"
# ...
pipelines:
  - namespace: chatqa
    samplePath: chatqa/reference-cpu.yaml # For HPU deployment, use chatqa/reference-hpu.yaml
    resourcesPath: chatqa/resources-reference-cpu.yaml # For HPU deployment, use chatqa/resources-reference-hpu.yaml
    type: chatqa
```
# Installation

```sh
ansible-playbook -u $USER -K playbooks/application.yaml --tags configure,install -e @inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml
```

Refer [Deployment](deployment/README.md) if you prefer to install with multiple options.

# Remove installation

```sh
cd deployment
ansible-playbook playbooks/application.yaml --tags uninstall -e @inventory/test-cluster/config.yaml
```
