### Telemetry for Enterprise RAG

#### Intro

Telemetry stack for Enterprise RAG is split into three related parts (main chart and three subcharts):

- [**metrics**](helm/README.md) - (base) provides metrics signals based on Prometheus and set of exporters and basic infrastructure for visualization (Grafana) and alerting (AlertManager + Rules)
- [**logs**](helm/charts/logs/README.md) - provides mechanism to collect logs (custom OpenTelemetry collector running as DaemonSet) from all pods and HOST system OS systemd units and backends to store and query (Loki)
- [**traces**](helm/charts/traces/README.md) - deploys backends to store and query traces (Tempo) and OpenTelemetry operator to automate collectors deployment,
- [**traces-instr**](helm/charts/traces-instr/README.md) - exposes central service where traces can be pushed (OpenTelemetry collector running as Deployment deployed by OpenTelemetry operator) and prepare auto zero-code instrumentations

These four charts need to be installed in order because of implicit dependencies (Loki and Tempo use Grafana as visualization and Prometheus for self-monitoring, Traces collector uses OpenTelemetry operator for deployment)

Please follow instructions in [helm/README.md](helm/README.md) to install all four charts.

#### Namespaces

- **metrics** and **logs** charts are deployed to **monitoring** namespace
- **traces** and **traces-instr** are deployed to **monitoring-traces** namespace

#### Architecture (overview)

This is the "default" telemetry pipeline when all "default" components are deployed (when following instructions "deployment" directory):

```
       ------>  otelcol-traces-deployment  ----------->  Tempo  --\  ------------------
      /                                                            \                   \
Pods --------------------------->  exporters ------------------------>  Prometheus ----->  Grafana
          \                                                                            /
journald ---->  otelcol-logs-daemonset(journalctl) ------------  Loki -----------------
```

where:

- **`otelcol-*`** are OpenTelemetry collectors, deployed as Deployment or DaemonSet running in "push by pods" or "pull from pods/journald"  mode for **traces** and **logs**,
- **`exporters`** are set of exporters as sources to scrape metrics by Prometheus (every pod can be treated as exporter using `ServiceMonitor` or `PodPmonitor` custom resources),
- **`Prometheus`**, **`Loki`** and **`Tempo`** are telemetry backends respectively for: metrics, logs and traces,
- **`Grafana`** is a frontend to query data from telemetry backends with configured data sources and provisioned dashboards.
